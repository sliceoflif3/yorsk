This project is made by me, `nakano_azunyan` on discord. This project's purpose is for me to learn web development, to break from tutorial hell and actually build something that actually works myself and not by following some step-by-step tutorial on the internet. 
This project will be full-stack in the future, with the following tech stack in mind: 
- Front-end: Angular
  - The CSS will be manually made, not by using a component library.
- Back-end: Java Spring
  - Currently, as of right now (3rd Jul 2023) I'm using Firebase for hosting the data and possible hosting the site.
- Deployment: AWS
